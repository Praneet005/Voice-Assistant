VOICE ASSISTANT :
This is generally a QnA program implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the GUI, gTTS for text-to-speech conversion. A while loop is generated for infinite number of inputs until the input is "bye"(when the input is bye the program terminates). Using if-else statements a user asks a question and the output is given in the form of speech accordingly.This can also be used for calculation. 

TOOLS USED:
tkinter: Python's standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.
gtts: A Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Text-to-Speech API.
geocoder: A simple and consistent geocoding library.

USAGE:
Enter your question or command in the provided text entry.
Click the "Ask" button to receive a spoken response.
If the user wants to know the available commands they can simply type "help" and it shows the list of commands that can be asked.

 This is not a completed project and can be easily modified by adding more questions as elif statements in the code.
